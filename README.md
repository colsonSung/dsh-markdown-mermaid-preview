# Markdown & Mermaid Preview for DeepSeek Harness

Read, render and edit the workspace files you are working on — inside the
DeepSeek Harness web UI, without leaving the conversation.

Open a `.md` file and the right-hand sidebar renders it as GitHub-flavoured
Markdown, with every ` ```mermaid ` block drawn as a real diagram. Open an
`.html`, `.svg` or an image and you can point at the part that needs work and
hand it to the agent as an annotation. There is also a workspace file tree
with search and pinning, and an in-place Markdown editor that writes back to
the file on disk.

```

## What you get

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Markdown rendering** | GFM tables, task lists, footnotes, front matter, code blocks with copy / wrap toggles |
| **Mermaid diagrams** | rendered as SVG, with zoom in / zoom out / fit-to-width controls |
| **In-place editing** | edit the Markdown source in the sidebar and save it back to the file |
| **AI annotation** | pick an element in an HTML/SVG page, or drag a box over an image, and send the selection to the agent |
| **File tree** | browse the workspace, search it, pin what matters, rename / move / delete from a context menu |
| **Straight to the agent** | "add to chat", "let the agent edit this", or comment on a selection — the file reference lands in the composer |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colsonSung/dsh-markdown-mermaid-preview.git
cd dsh-markdown-mermaid-preview
./install.sh              # installs into the profile of the running Harness
```

`install.sh` takes an optional profile name (`./install.sh web`) and is
idempotent. It installs the package into the profile and adds the bundle row
to `<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`. **Restart the Harness afterwards** — the
host half of a plugin is loaded at start-up.

Manual equivalent:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add ./plugin
```

```yaml
# <profile>/cordis.patch.yml
- insert:
    - id: markdown-mermaid-preview
      name: 'dsh-markdown-mermaid-preview'
```

Requirements: the DeepSeek Harness CLI (`dsh`) on your `PATH`, and Node.js 22
only if you want to rebuild the client bundles from source.

### Uninstall

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-markdown-mermaid-preview
```

Then delete the bundle row from `<profile>/cordis.patch.yml` and restart the
Harness.

## How it works

The plugin has two halves, exactly like every DeepSeek Harness plugin.

**Host half** — `plugin/index.js`, plain Node, runs inside the Harness
process. It registers four commands on the session:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/mmd-save` | write edited content back to a workspace file |
| `/mmd-fs` | file operations for the file-tree context menu: `mkdir`, `create`, `rename`/`move`, `copy`, `delete` |
| `/rename` | rename the current session |
| `/retitle` | regenerate the session title from the whole conversation |

**Client half** — `plugin/src/client-entry.js`, a browser bundle that the
Harness web shell loads. It registers three document-preview tabs in the
right-hand sidebar (`Markdown (Mermaid)`, `HTML (AI Annotate)`,
`Image (AI Annotate)`), the *Edit* and *Locate* document actions, and the
*Files* tab (workspace tree, search, pinning, context menu). The web side
calls the host commands above through the Harness remote-command API — it
never touches the filesystem directly from the browser.

Two renderer chunks are fetched on demand by the Harness client module
system, so they cost nothing until you use them:

| File | Contents | Loaded when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin/client.editor.js` | `marked` (Markdown → HTML) and `turndown` (HTML → Markdown) | you open the Markdown editor |
| `plugin/client.mermaid.js` | `mermaid` | a document contains a diagram |

### Built bundles are committed

`plugin/client.js`, `plugin/client.editor.js` and `plugin/client.mermaid.js`
are **committed to this repository**. The Harness plugin installer does not
run a build step, so a fresh clone has to work as-is — and it does: clone,
run `./install.sh`, restart, done. No `npm install` required.

If you change anything under `plugin/src`, rebuild the bundles:

```bash
cd plugin
npm install          # esbuild + the renderer libraries
npm run build        # writes client.js, client.editor.js, client.mermaid.js
```

The build uses `esbuild` with `legalComments: 'eof'`, so the `/*! ... */`
license banners of the bundled third-party code are kept at the end of each
bundle.

A rebuild is *not* guaranteed to be byte-identical to the committed bundle:
npm and pnpm lay out nested dependencies differently, so a few transitive
packages inside `client.mermaid.js` can resolve to a different copy. The
committed bundles are the ones that shipped in the `v1.0.0` release — rebuild
and commit the result if you change `plugin/src`.

## Security and privacy

The plugin holds **no credentials**, asks for **no API keys**, and makes **no
network requests of its own** — Markdown, Mermaid and the annotation UI all
run locally in your browser.

* **File access.** File reads and writes go through the Harness file API. The
  host half refuses relative paths, any path containing `..`, non-regular
  files, and writes larger than 4 MB. The file-tree operations (create,
  rename, move, copy, delete) run with the privileges of the Harness process
  itself, so install this plugin only if you trust the code that drives your
  UI.
* **What is written to disk.** Only one file: the bundle row in
  `<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`. Nothing else, and no secrets.
* **What is stored in the browser.** Your pinned-files list, in `localStorage`
  under `mmd-pinned::<workspace>`. Clearing the site data removes it.
* **Third-party code.** The bundles inline MIT-licensed libraries (mermaid,
  marked, turndown and mermaid's own dependency tree). They are ordinary
  browser libraries with no telemetry.

## Third-party licenses

This plugin's own code is MIT licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

The published bundles inline the following third-party packages, all under
the MIT license:

| Package | Version | Copyright | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) | 12.2.0 | Copyright (c) 2014 - 2022 Knut Sveidqvist | `plugin/client.mermaid.js` |
| [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) | 18.1.1 | Copyright (c) 2019+, MarkedJS | `plugin/client.editor.js` |
| [turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) | 7.2.4 | Copyright (c) 2017 Dom Christie | `plugin/client.editor.js` |
| [turndown-plugin-gfm](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown-plugin-gfm) | 1.0.2 | Copyright (c) 2017 Dom Christie | `plugin/client.editor.js` |
| [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) | 0.28.2 | Copyright (c) 2020 Evan Wallace | build tool only, not shipped |

`plugin/client.mermaid.js` additionally contains mermaid's own dependency
tree (d3, cytoscape, lodash-es, dompurify, dayjs and others) under their
respective MIT / ISC licenses. The build keeps the `/*! ... */` legal comments
of those packages at the end of the bundle, but it does **not** inline every
license text — in particular mermaid's own MIT notice is not inside the
bundle, so it is reproduced here:
